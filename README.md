# 🧠 My Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Journey

Welcome to my **DSA Learning Journey!**  
This repository documents my progress as I explore and master **Data Structures and Algorithms** — one problem, one concept at a time.  
My goal is to **build strong problem-solving skills** and **understand DSA deeply**, not just memorize solutions.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen core DSA fundamentals.
- Practice problem-solving daily.
- Understand time and space complexity clearly.
- Write clean, optimized, and well-documented code.
- Prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.
